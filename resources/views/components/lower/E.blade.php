                In celebration of World No Tobacco Day and National No Smoking Month, the City of Taguig gathered more 
                than 220 members of the Taguig Smoke-Free Task Force, representatives from the City Health Office, youth sector, 
                and vape business owners at Lakeshore Hall in Barangay Lower Bicutan on Wednesday, June 5.
                <br><br>
                With the theme “Protecting Children from Tobacco Industry Interference", the event aims to strengthen the City’s 
                tobacco control program under its Transformative, Lively, and Caring City agenda. As part of the celebration, 
                Taguig Mayor Lani Cayetano led the destruction of confiscated cigarettes and e-cigarettes/vapes, symbolizing Taguig’s 
                commitment to a smoke-free environment.
                <br><br>
                The celebration adopted a multi-sectoral approach to achieving a smoke-free Taguig where CHO conducted lectures on Taguig’s 
                tobacco control program, TB program, lifestyle-related diseases, and mental health. These lectures tackled the adverse effects 
                of tobacco and vape consumption and highlighted the overall benefits to health and well being of not engaging in or quitting these products.

                The City of Taguig entered into two major agreements with key partners on Friday, August 16, 2024, at the 
                Grand Hyatt Hotel in BGC, Fort Bonifacio. The agreements aim to enhance healthcare accessibility and improve programs 
                for the health of mothers and children in the City. 
                <br><br>
                The first initiative, led by CareSpan Asia Inc., in partnership with Temasek Foundation, is a pilot program that brings 
                together multiple stakeholders in a Public-Private-Philanthropic Partnership (PPPP) to onboard 350,000 underserved 
                citizens in Taguig City. Under this partnership, CareSpan will provide Taguig City with access to its advanced Digital Health care platform. 
                <br><br>
                This platform, which is composed of an electronic medical records (EMR) system and telemedicine capabilities, will be integrated into 
                Taguig's local healthcare program to ensure that target beneficiaries have access to quality medical services.
                <br><br>
                Singapore’s Temasek Foundation supports this initiative with a funding of S$2.12 million to ensure the program’s sustainability and potential 
                scalability to other localities. For its part, the City of Taguig will train volunteers and health workers to engage 
                low-income communities, promoting greater health awareness and encouraging enrollment in UHC.

                In a parallel initiative to improve maternal and child health, the SingHealth Duke-NUS Maternal and Child Health Research Institute 
                (MCHRI), led by KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) Singapore, has partnered with Taguig City to enhance maternal and child health services. 
                <br><br>
                The partnership will focus on improving key health indicators, infrastructure planning, and capacity building in Taguig’s 
                maternal and child health facilities.
                <br><br>
                It will include training and academic exchanges, development of health programs, and joint scientific activities. A team of experts from KKH and 
                MCHRI has already begun their visit to Taguig City on Thursday, August 15, engaging in a symposium on maternal and child health and assessing local facilities.

                The City of Taguig actively took part in the third quarter National Simultaneous Earthquake Drill 
                (NSED) to enhance disaster preparedness and resilience.
                <br><br>
                Government and private employees, uniformed personnel, students, and residents practiced the “Duck, Cover, and Hold” technique, 
                as well as how to reach their designated evacuation sites and apply other safety measures in response to an earthquake.
                The NSED was successfully conducted across public schools, offices, barangays, and city-owned buildings and facilities.
                <br><br>
                Rescue teams showcased proper procedures for assisting trapped individuals and those with injuries during a simulated rescue operation.
                <br><br>
                The City also deployed its state-of-the-art Mobile Control and Command Vehicle (MOCCOV), a vital tool in disaster management that allows 
                for rapid coordination of resources and personnel during emergencies.
                <br><br>
                Under the leadership of Mayor Lani Cayetano, Taguig is committed to building a safer and more resilient community by actively participating 
                in all National Simultaneous Earthquake Drills and promoting the importance of preparedness and teamwork in responding to disasters.
